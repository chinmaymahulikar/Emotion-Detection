This is a Deep Learning project which detects/predicts the facial expressions on a human face.
It uses Convolutional Neural Networks, to train the model on image dataset.
I have trained 4 different models which are: CNN, Image Augmentation, VGGNet(Transfer Learning) & ResNet-50 (Transfer Learning). Among which the ResNet-50 model provides more efficiency in the predictions.
This is a project-based learning of CNN.
